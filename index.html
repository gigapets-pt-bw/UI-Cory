                        <p>"I got this app because my two children are especially picky eaters, since beginning to use it I have noticed that they have become much more involved in meal time as well as more open to try new foods because the only thing they
                            wanted was to make sure that their new Gigapet was happy and healthy as well, this app has changed our lives and now I know that my kids are getting the nutrition they need!" </br>
